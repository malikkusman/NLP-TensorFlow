    "INTRODUCTION: This material focuses on processing text data for training neural networks, specifically using a public dataset for sarcasm detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding the Sarcasm Detection Dataset\n",
    "- The dataset contains three key elements: a label indicating if the headline is sarcastic (1 for sarcastic, 0 for not), the headline itself, and a link to the article.\n",
    "- It is designed to be straightforward and easy to work with, making it suitable for beginners.\n",
    "\n",
    "Loading Data into Python\n",
    "- To load the dataset into Python, you can use the JSON library, which allows you to convert the data into a Python-friendly format.\n",
    "- By opening the file and using `json.load`, you can create lists for headlines, sarcastic labels, and article links.\n",
    "\n",
    "Preparing Data for Tokenization\n",
    "- After loading the data, you can create separate lists for sentences (headlines) and labels (sarcastic indicators) to prepare for tokenization.\n",
    "- Iterating through the dataset allows you to extract and organize the necessary information for further processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, this is a foundational step in working with text data for machine learning. Take your time to understand each part, and don't hesitate to ask questions if you need clarification! You're doing great!"

    "INTRODUCTION: This material focuses on processing the sarcasm dataset, creating a vectorized layer, and understanding the implications of a larger vocabulary in natural language processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Creating a sentences list\n",
    "- You start by creating a list of sentences from the headlines in the sarcasm dataset, which serves as the foundation for further processing.\n",
    "- This step is crucial as it prepares the data for vectorization, allowing for better analysis and understanding of the text.\n",
    "\n",
    "Vectorized layer and vocabulary\n",
    "- By creating a vectorized layer and adapting it on your sentences, you generate a vocabulary that is significantly larger than previous examples.\n",
    "- This expanded vocabulary enables more nuanced understanding and processing of the text data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Post padded sequences\n",
    "- After vectorization, you can create post padded sequences, which are longer and contain higher numerical values due to the increased vocabulary size.\n",
    "- You also have the option to set up pre padding, which will be discussed further in the notebook walkthrough.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, each step in this process builds on the previous one, enhancing your understanding of natural language processing. Keep practicing, and don't hesitate to ask questions if you need further clarification! You've got this!\n",

    "INTRODUCTION: This material focuses on the process of loading and processing text data using JSON files, creating a vocabulary from headlines, and understanding text vectorization in natural language processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Loading and processing data\n",
    "- The JSON package is used to read data from a JSON file, which is then stored as a list in a variable.\n",
    "- Each element in the list contains an article link, a headline, and an indicator of whether the headline is sarcastic or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Creating a vocabulary and text vectorization\n",
    "- Headlines are extracted from the sentences list to create a vocabulary.\n",
    "- A text vectorization layer is instantiated, and the `adapt` method is called on the list of sentences to generate integer sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Padding sequences\n",
    "- By default, text vectorization generates post-padded sequences, but this behavior can be changed to create ragged tensors with varying lengths.\n",
    "- The `pad_sequences` utility can be used to pre-pad sequences, allowing for flexibility in handling different dataset sizes.\n",
    "\n",
